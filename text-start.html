    <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes
        that I have read over the years.</p>

    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
        grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper></li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
        <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
        <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
            <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
        chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>

    <p>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
        made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</p>

    <p>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</p>

    <p>I am <em>glad</em> you weren't <em>late</em>.</p>

    <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>

    <p>I am counting on you. <strong>Do not</strong> be late!</p>

    <p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong> —
        if you drink it, <strong>you may <em>die</em></strong>.</p>
